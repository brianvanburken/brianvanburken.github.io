* Commit their specific editor files (like .idea) so other use those
* Add their environment to the git repo gitingore (this gets big when each have their own OS and IDE)

Always ignore IDE and OS specific stuff in your global gitignore. This way there is less noise unrelated to the repository in the gitignore
