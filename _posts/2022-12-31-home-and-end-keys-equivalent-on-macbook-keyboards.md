The MacBooks have a shortened keyboard where some keys are left out.
A few of these keys are "Home" and "End", which I needed to test some functionality.

Apple has cleverly hidden these keys behind shortcuts. Using the `Fn` key, we can access those.

For "Home", we need to press `Fn` and arrow left key. And for "End", `Fn` with the right arrow key.

As for a bonus, the `Fn` with arrow up and down keys map to "Page Up" and "Page Down".

You can read more about the shortcuts [here][1].
